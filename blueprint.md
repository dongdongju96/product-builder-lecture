## Implemented Plan: "High-Quality Site Guide" Website

**Overview:** I have built a small, multi-page informational website that serves as a guide to creating a high-quality site for AdSense approval. The content is a synthesized and well-structured version of the two blog posts provided by the user. The design is modern, clean, user-friendly, and responsive, embodying the very principles it describes.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Site Structure & HTML:**
    *   Created a multi-page structure with a homepage (`index.html`), a "Content Quality" page (`content.html`), an "Ad Placement" page (`ads.html`), and an "About" page (`about.html`).
    *   The homepage features a welcoming hero section.
    *   All pages use semantic HTML5 (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) and a consistent navigation menu.

2.  **Content:**
    *   Synthesized the key principles from the two provided AdSense blog posts.
    *   Populated `content.html` with detailed advice on creating unique, user-focused, and honest content.
    *   Populated `ads.html` with best practices for ad placement, including ad-to-content ratio and avoiding ads on non-content pages.
    *   Populated `about.html` with a clear explanation of the site's purpose.

3.  **Modern CSS (`style.css`):**
    *   Developed a single, consistent stylesheet for the entire site.
    *   Used a modern, clean design with a professional color palette and typography (using CSS variables).
    *   Implemented a responsive navigation bar and page layouts, ensuring readability on both mobile and desktop.
    *   Added subtle hover effects on navigation links.

4.  **JavaScript (`main.js`):**
    *   Kept JavaScript minimal to ensure fast loading times.
    *   Implemented a script to add an `active` class to the current navigation link, improving user experience.

## Next Steps

The website is now a strong embodiment of the principles for creating a high-quality site suitable for AdSense review. I have completed the user's request. I will now commit and push all the changes to the connected GitHub repository.
