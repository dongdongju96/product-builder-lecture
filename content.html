    <h1>Content is King</h1>
    <p>Creating a high-quality site starts with providing unique, valuable, and user-focused content. Here are the core principles to follow, based on Google's own guidelines.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Create Unique and Valuable Content</h2>
      <p>Your content should offer something new and valuable to users. Avoid duplicating content from other sites, and instead, focus on providing a unique perspective, original research, or a valuable service. The goal is to make your site a go-to resource in your niche.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Differentiate your site:</strong> Offer unique value that sets you apart from competitors.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid duplicate content:</strong> Do not copy content from other sources or use the same content across multiple pages.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Focus on the User, Not Just Keywords</h2>
      <p>Write for people, not for search engines. While keywords are important, your primary focus should be on creating an engaging and informative experience for your visitors. Don't create "doorway" pages or pages with minimal content just to rank for specific keywords.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize user engagement:</strong> Create interactive experiences based on user interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure easy navigation:</strong> Your site should be well-structured and easy for users to find what they're looking for.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Be Honest and Transparent</h2>
      <p>Deliver on the promises you make in your content. Don't mislead users with false claims or deceptive techniques to increase ad impressions. A trustworthy site is a high-quality site.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fulfill promises:</strong> If you promise a product or service, make sure you deliver it.</li>
        <li><strong>Build trust:</strong> Honesty is key to building a loyal audience and a positive reputation.</li>
      </ul>
