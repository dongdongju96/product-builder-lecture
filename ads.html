    <h1>Effective Ad Placement</h1>
    <p>How you place ads is just as important as the content itself. A good user experience depends on a healthy balance between content and advertisements.</p>

    <section>
      <h2><span class="material-symbols-outlined">balance</span> 1. Maintain a Balanced Ad-to-Content Ratio</h2>
      <p>Ads should supplement your content, not overwhelm it. If a page has more ads than content, it can be frustrating for users and may be flagged as low-quality. The focus should always be on the user's journey and the value you provide.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content first:</strong> Ensure that ads do not overshadow your main content.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance page value:</strong> Ads should feel like a natural part of the page, not a distraction.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><span class="material-symbols-outlined">no_accounts</span> 2. Avoid Ads on Non-Content Pages</h2>
      <p>Placing ads on pages that don't have substantial, original content is against AdSense policies. This includes pages that are part of a user flow but don't offer standalone value.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No ads on "thank you" pages:</strong> Do not place ads on pages shown after a user makes a purchase or signs up.</li>
        <li><strong>No ads on 404 or login pages:</strong> These pages are functional and should not be monetized with display ads.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><span class="material-symbols-outlined">integration_instructions</span> 3. Integrate Ads Thoughtfully</h2>
      <p>Think about the user's experience when deciding where to place ads. Avoid disruptive placements, like ads that pop up unexpectedly or shift the layout of the page as it loads. A seamless experience is crucial for keeping users on your site.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User-centric placement:</strong> Consider how ads will affect the user's ability to consume your content.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable layouts:</strong> Avoid layout shifts caused by ads loading in.</li>
      </ul>
